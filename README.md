This folder contains two projects from was my fundamentals prep course for Thinkful Data Science bootcamp:

- "Critical vs Popular Movie Ratings.ipynb" is a statistical investigation of differences between critical and popular ratings of movies on review aggregators like Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes

- "Movie Ratings Recency.ipynb" contains a proposal and basic execution of an analysis of differences between movies rated individually soon after watching versus movies rated in batches long after watching.  (The assignment was to write a research proposal.)

All other files are data or support files.
